To install:

COA Mixin:

1. Copy coa.rb [msf directory]/lib/msf/core/exploit/ 
2. Edit [msf directory]/lib/msf/core/exploit.rb and add require ''

Example Scanner Module:

1. Create [msf directory]/modules/auxiliary/scanner/coa/ directory
2. Copy scanner.rb to the above directory

Notes/Bugs: 

1. This module relies on the COM-ON-AIR Linux driver and as such won't 
work with Windows systems.

2. The example module uses an infinite loop while scanning, I haven't 
found an elegant way to break out of this w/out using ctrl-c. Thus this 
leaves the file descriptor to the device open. Restarting the module 
won't work you will need to restart Metasploit. I will figure out a fix 
for this at some point in an update.
